# Arduino pulse sensor wifi code

Arduino code that reads data from a pusle sensor, using the [PulseSensor_Amped_Arduino](https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensor_Amped_Arduino/) code.
And sends the data to a database using an ESP-256 wifi module.

This code was used for a sleep tracking device project.
